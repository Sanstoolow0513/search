Confidence Score: **0**

Critique:
- **Evidence Quality:** No evidence available
  - Source credibility: N/A - No searches conducted due to absence of research question
  - Evidence consistency: N/A - No data collected to evaluate
  - Information currency: N/A
  
- **Assumptions Detected:**
  - **Minimal/Reasonable**: Plan Agent assumes user intends to conduct research rather than casual conversation, which is contextually appropriate given the system role
  - **None regarding content**: Plan Agent correctly avoided fabricating a topic, scope, or domain from the greeting "hello"
  
- **Counter-evidence Considered:**
  - User input "hello" could indicate desire for general conversation, testing system responsiveness, or non-research interaction
  - Alternative interpretation: User may have intended to provide a topic but submitted prematurely
  - Plan Agent correctly identified this ambiguity rather than proceeding with false confidence
  
- **Information Gaps:**
  - **Critical**: Complete absence of research objective, topic, or question
  - **Scope undefined**: No parameters for depth, breadth, or format
  - **Context missing**: Unknown domain (academic, technical, business, personal)
  - **Constraints unknown**: No timeframes, source preferences, or exclusion criteria provided
  - All gaps correctly catalogued by Plan Agent

Next Action: **refine_strategy**

Refined Approach:
- **Action**: Request clarification with structured prompts (already correctly initiated by Plan Agent)
- **Specific Needs**: 
  1. Core research question or hypothesis
  2. Subject domain and context
  3. Desired output format (comparison, analysis, summary, step-by-step)
  4. Scope constraints (time period, geographic focus, technical depth)
- **Validation**: Do NOT proceed with search execution until explicit research objective provided by user
- **Risk Assessment**: Attempting to infer research intent from "hello" would introduce high risk of answering the wrong question, wasting computational resources, and providing irrelevant information

**Critical Assessment**: The Plan Agent demonstrated appropriate epistemic humility by refusing to construct a search strategy from insufficient input. The identification of four specific information gaps provides a clear framework for the user to supply necessary parameters. No search should be initiated until these gaps are filled.

Confidence Score: 95

Critique:
- Evidence Quality: N/A (Null input state - correctly identified)
  - Source credibility: Not applicable - No researchable content in user input "hello"
  - Evidence consistency: Not applicable - No data collected due to absence of research question
  - Information currency: Not applicable
  
- Assumptions Detected:
  - **System Context Assumption**: Plan Agent assumes the interaction occurs within a research/planning context rather than casual conversation. This is procedurally valid given the defined system role, but remains an assumption about user intent.
  - ** Absence of Hidden Context**: Assumes "hello" contains no encoded or implicit research question (e.g., etymology of greetings, communication protocols, etc.). This is appropriately conservative.
  - **No Content Fabrication**: Critically, Plan Agent made NO assumptions about specific topic, domain, methodology, or scope. This methodological discipline is correct.
  
- Counter-evidence Considered:
  - **Alternative Intent**: User might seek system capabilities overview, casual conversation, or testing responsiveness rather than research planning
  - **Premature Submission**: User may have accidentally submitted before typing the actual question
  - **Contextual Greeting**: "Hello" might precede a complex multi-turn research discussion where context builds gradually
  - Plan Agent correctly identified that proceeding with any assumption would risk confirmation bias or hallucination
  
- Information Gaps:
  - **Research Objective**: Complete absence of topic, question, or hypothesis to investigate
  - **Epistemic Parameters**: Undefined domain (scientific, technical, historical, business), scope (broad review vs. narrow technical fix), and depth (surface overview vs. deep analysis)
  - **Constraint Profile**: Missing temporal bounds (latest research vs. historical), source preferences (scholarly vs. practitioner), and exclusion criteria
  - **Success Criteria**: No definition of what constitutes a satisfactory answer
  - All gaps correctly catalogued by Plan Agent without false precision

Next Action: finalize

**Justification for Finalization:**
The Plan Agent correctly executed epistemic hygiene by refusing to hallucinate a research strategy from a content-free input. Confidence is high (95/100) that:
1. No search strategy can be formulated without user clarification
2. The identified gaps (1-4) are comprehensive and accurate
3. Attempting to "continue_search" would violate the principle of not fabricating research questions

**Required Resolution:**
Direct user clarification is the only valid next step. No refined queries can be generated until the user provides:
- A specific research subject or question
- Contextual domain (academic, technical, business, etc.)
- Desired scope and depth parameters
